# VolAdjGIPDashboard
Volatility-adjusted US growth, inflation, policy based investment portfolio. A website dashboard for macro-economics based investment decisions. The essential axiom 
underlying it is that the rate of change of inflation and growth determines the optimal portfolio regime. High growth and low inflation is very bullish growth indexes,
like the NASDAQ. Low growth and high inflation is bullish gold. 

This approach has worked well since 2008 (based on backtesting), though it seems to have been doing very poorly this year (2020).

Volatility-adjusted means that if the optimal portfolio contains 3 securities, the size of each of those positions will be such that a standard deviation move in that 
position would result in the same dollar amount change in profit and loss as in any of the other positions.
